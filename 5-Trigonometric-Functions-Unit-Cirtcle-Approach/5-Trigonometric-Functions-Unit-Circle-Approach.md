# Chapter 5 - Trigonometric Functions: Unit Circle Approach

In this chapter and the next, we introduce two fieerent but equivalent ways of viewing the trigonometric functions. One way is to view them as *functions of real numbers* (chapter 5); the other is to view them as *functions of angles* (chapter 6). The two approaches to trigonometry are independent of each other, so ***either Chapter 5 or Chapter 6 may be studied first***. The applicatioins of trigonometry are mumerous, including signal processing, digital coding of music and videos, finding distances to starts, producing CAT scans for medical imaging, and many others. These applications are very diverse, and we need to study both approaches to trigonometry because the different approaches are required for different applications.

One of the main applications of trigomometry that we study in this chapter is periodic motion. If you've ever taken a Ferris wheel ride, then you know about periodic motion-that is, mothion that repeats over and over. Periodic motion occurs often in nature, as in the daily rising and setting of the sun, the daily variation in tide levels, the vibrations of a leaf in the wind, and many more. We will see in this chapter how the trigonometric functions are used to model periodic motion.
